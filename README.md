## :dart: Add the bot to your server

If you are looking for a music bot for your Discord server then go ahead and [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=952649023230197792&permissions=3155968&scope=bot) it from here. Visite the website [musx.me](https://musx.me) for more details about the bot.

## :rocket: Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) installed on your computer. Apart from this you will need to have a [discord](https://discord.com/) account and a server where you are admin. If you don't have any such server then you can simply create a new one for yourself. Finally you will need a discord bot to which you can link this code. You can create one for yourself from the [Discord Developer Console](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

```
node@v16.6.0 or higher
npm@8.5.0 or higher
git@2.25.1 or higher
```

## :wrench: How to set up the bot locally for development

From your command line, first clone and then configure the neccessary files and start the server.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Shashwat545/Musx.git
# Go into the repository
$ cd Musx
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Rename .env_sample to .env and put your discord bot token inside it
#After that we start the server
$ node index.js
```
