## :rocket: Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) installed on your computer. Apart from this you will need to have a [discord](https://discord.com/) account and a server where you are admin. If you don't have any such server then you can simply create a new one for yourself. Finally you will need a discord bot to which you can link this code. You can create one for yourself from the [Discord Developer Console](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

```
node@v16.6.0 or higher
